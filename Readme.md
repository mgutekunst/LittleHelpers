### Visibility Switcher

Switches Visibility.Visible to Visibility.Collapsed and vice versa

### Register and deregister EventHandler

Register or deregister an EventHandler (+= &lt;==&gt; -=)

Install
-------

Download the .nupkg file from the releases tab. Then tell ReSharper where to find additional plugins.

Alternatively you can use the custom nuget repo. Look at [Build status](#build-status) for the urls.
