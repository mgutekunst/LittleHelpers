* Little Helpers
  This project contains a ReSharper plugin that hopefully simplifies the life of
  a programmer that uses VisualStudio. It contains three ContextActions that
  currently only work in C# files.
** Features
*** True/False Switcher
    Switches true to false and vice versa
*** Visibility Switcher
    Switches Visibility.Visible to Visibility.Collapsed and vice versa
*** Register and deregister EventHandler
    Register or deregister an EventHandler (+= <==> -=)
** Install
   Download the .nupkg file from the releases tab. Then tell ReSharper where to find additional plugins. 
** Bugs/ Feature Requests
   If you find a bug or want to request another feature, just go to the issue
   section and create one.
